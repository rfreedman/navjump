An address book for Google Navigation.

The motiviation for this app was my dissatisfaction with the way that Google Navigation handles addresses 
- it only offers 'recent' locations. 

Most other 'navigation address books' assume that you want to use contacts from your contact list for navigation.

I wanted a stand-alone place to keep addresses that I navigate to, without having them tied to 'contacts'.

The features of this app include:

* Enter address directly, or add latitude / longitude coordinates directly, or use your current location.

* Filter addresses by 'favorites', or by recently used

* Set the threshold (in number of days) for addresses to be considered recently used (default is 7 days).
